# Sleep Quest

##### Project Description:

The goal of our project is to help people pay more attention to their sleep by introducing gamified elements to their habit formation. Taking inspiration from other gamified learning apps such as Duolingo, we believe this could be a fun and engaging way to encourage users to get their sleep habits on track. 

##### Technologies Used:

We used Figma to help generate our frontend, our frontend is ran with react, our backend is api calls through java, we used standard http requests to communicate between them.

##### Intructions for Use:

Download file from github, in a cmd window do cd filepath, run npm i, then do npm run dev. 



##### Instructions to run server side:

The server.java in the backend folder is the file to run that will open up the api server on localhost:8080

to test api calls You can run the fetchTest.html in the backend folder and check the log, it ensures that the token you send is up to date.
