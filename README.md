# Sleep Quest

##### Project Description:

The goal of our project is to help people pay more attention to their sleep by introducing gamified elements to their habit formation. Taking inspiration from other gamified learning apps such as Duolingo, we believe this could be a fun and engaging way to encourage users to get their sleep habits on track.
